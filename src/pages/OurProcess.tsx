    desc: "Every BTN engagement starts with a rigorous assessment of the land or asset and a proforma baseline. This is not a general feasibility study—it is a targeted analysis to determine whether a hospitality outcome makes financial sense for this specific site, and if so, what form maximises value.",
    deliverables: [
      "Site review and development constraints analysis",
      "Preliminary highest-and-best-use assessment",

    desc: "With the baseline established, BTN develops and evaluates multiple hospitality scenarios—testing density options, program mix, room count, brand tier, and revenue projections against cost and return benchmarks. The goal is to identify the scenario that is not just theoretically optimal, but practically achievable.",

    deliverables: [
      "Brand identification and shortlisting",
      "Franchise term negotiation support",
      "Key money and incentive structuring (where applicable)",
